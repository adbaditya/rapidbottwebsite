                    Rapidbott</h1>
                <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 18px;">Information privacy, also known as data privacy or
                    data protection, is the relationship between the collection and dissemination of data, technology,
                    the public expectation of privacy, legal and political issues surrounding them. Privacy concerns
                    exist wherever personally identifiable information or other sensitive information is collected,
                    stored, used, and finally destroyed or deleted – in digital form or otherwise. Improper or
                    non-existent disclosure control can be the root cause for privacy issues. Data privacy issues may
                    arise in response to information from a wide range of sources.</p>

                <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 18px;">This Privacy Policy is intended to meet our duties
                    of transparency under the "General Data Protection Regulation"("GDPR") and "Health Insurance
                    Portability and Accountability Act "("HIPAA").</p>
                <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 18px;">We will post any modifications or changes to this
                    Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
                <h2 style="margin-top: 60px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: 'Montserrat'; font-weight: 700;">Our Relationship to You</h2>
                <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 18px;">It is important that you identify which
                    relationship(s) you have with Rapidbott to understand Rapidbott’s data protection obligations and your
                    rights to your Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 18px;">Rapidbott has the following relationships:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 18px;">A “User” is an individual providing Personal
                        Information to us via our website or other services, software or application, such as by signing
                        up for our newsletter or making an account and posting on the forums. Here, Rapidbott is a data
                        controller.</li>
                    <li style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 18px;">A “Customer” is a specific type of User that
                        has engaged us to act as an agent (a “data processor”) by obtaining our Services. The Customer
                        is the data controller, and Rapidbott is their data processor.</li>
                    <li style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 18px;">A “Customer End User” is an individual that
                        provides their Personal Information to our Customers. We do not control the purposes or the
                        means by which their Personal Information is collected, and we are not in a direct relationship
                        with Customer End Users. If Customer End User who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend,
                        or delete inaccurate data should direct their query to the Rapidbott Customer (the data
                        controller). If requested to remove data we will respond within a reasonable timeframe. In
                        certain circumstances we may be required by law to retain your personal information, or may need
                        to retain your personal information in order to continue providing a service.</li>
                    <li style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 18px;">A “Customer” is a specific type of User that
                        has engaged us to act as an agent (a “data processor”) by obtaining our Services. The Customer
                        is the data controller, and Rapidbott is their data processor.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="icon-section">
                    <div class="icon"> <i class="fa fa-check-circle-o"></i> </div>
                    <h6 style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 16px;">Hereinafter we may refer to Customers and
                        Users collectively as “You.”</h6>

                <h2 style="margin-top: 60px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: 'Montserrat'; font-weight: 700;">Your Rights Relating to Your Personal Data</h2>
                <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">You have the right under this
                    Privacy Policy to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 18px;">Request access to your Personal Data. If you
                        are in certain jurisdictions, this enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Data we hold
                        about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
                    <li style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 18px;">Request correction of the Personal Data that
                        we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold
                        about you corrected.</li>
                    <li style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 18px;">Request erasure of your Personal Data. This
                        enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Data where there is no good reason for us
                        continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal
                        Data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).</li>
                    <li style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 18px;">Object to processing of your Personal Data.
                        This right exists where we are relying on a legitimate interest as the legal basis for our
                        processing and there is something about your particular situation, which makes you want to
                        object to processing of your Personal Data on this ground. You also have the right to object
                        where we are processing your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes.</li>
                    <li style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 18px;">Request the restriction of processing of your
                        Personal Data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of Personal Data about you
                        in certain scenarios (for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for
                        processing it).</li>
                    <li style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 18px;">Request the transfer of your Personal Data.
                        If you are in certain jurisdictions, we will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen,
                        your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right
                        only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or
                        where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
                    <li style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 18px;">Withdraw consent. This right only exists
                        where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Data ("Consent Withdrawal"). If you
                        withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide you with access to certain specific
                        functionalities of our Site. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw
                        your consent.</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 18px;">How to exercise your rights. If you want to
                    exercise any of the rights described above, please contact us using support@rapidbott.com</p>
                <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 18px;">Typically, you will not have to pay a fee to
                    access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, except in relation to
                    Consent Withdrawal, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive
                    or excessive, or, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. We may need to
                    request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to
                    access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to
                    ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also
                    contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
                    We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer
                    than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this
                    case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
                <h2 style="margin-top: 60px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: 'Montserrat'; font-weight: 700;">Complaints</h2>
                <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 18px;">If you would like to submit a complaint regarding
                    this Privacy Policy or our practices in relation to your Personal Data, please contact us at:
                    support@rapidbott.com with the subject: ‘Data privacy’. We will reply to your complaint as soon as we
                    can. If you feel that your complaint has not been adequately resolved, please note that if you are
                    in the EU the GDPR gives you the right to contact your local data protection supervisory authority.

                    elsewhere for the purposes described in this policy. We may also store Personal Data in locations
                    outside the direct control of Rapidbott (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting
                    providers). By accessing the Services and providing us with your Personal Data, you consent to and
                    authorize the export of Personal Data and its storage and use as specified in this Privacy Policy.
                </p>
                <h2 style="margin-top: 60px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: 'Montserrat'; font-weight: 700;">How We Protect Your Personal Data</h2>
                <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 18px;">Rapidbott uses industry-standard physical,
                    managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal
                    information. We limit access to your Personal Data to those employees and other staff who have a
                    business need to have such access. All such people are subject to a contractual duty of
                    confidentiality. We periodically review our policies and procedures to evaluate their effectiveness
                    and ensure that they remain up to date.</p>
                <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 18px;">We have put in place procedures to deal with any
                    actual or suspected Personal Data breach. In the event that personal information is compromised as a
                    result of such a breach of security, Rapidbott will promptly notify those persons whose personal
                    information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this
                    Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.</p>
                <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 18px;">Rapidbott cannot ensure that your Personal Data will
                    be protected, controlled or otherwise managed pursuant to this Privacy Policy if you share your
                    login and password information with any third party, including any third party operating a website
                    or providing other services.</p>
                <h2 style="margin-top: 60px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: 'Montserrat'; font-weight: 700;">Links to Other Websites & Third Party
                    Applications</h2>
                <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 18px;">Our services may contain links to other websites
                    not operated or controlled by Rapidbott. We are not responsible for the content, accuracy or opinions
                    expressed in such websites, and such websites are not investigated, monitored or checked for
                    accuracy or completeness by us.</p>
                <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 18px;">Please remember that when you use a link to go
                    from the Services to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and
                    interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our Site, is subject to that
                    website's own rules and policies. Such third parties may use their own cookies or other methods to
                    collect information about you.</p>
                <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 18px;">If you’d like to use third party software/services
                    with our Services, please keep in mind that when you interact with them you may provide information
                    about yourself to those third parties. We don’t own or control these third parties and they have
                    their own rules about collection, use and sharing of information. You should review their rules and
                    policies when installing and using any third party software/services.</p>
                <h2 style="margin-top: 60px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: 'Montserrat'; font-weight: 700;">Customer’s Obligations to Respect Individual
                    End User’s Rights</h2>
                <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 18px;">In connection with using our Services, you may
                    receive and determine what to do with certain personal information from your End Users, such as when
                    communicating with them and entering into transactions with them. This means you process personal
                    information (for example, name, email address, and shipping address) and, to the extent you do so,
                    under EU law, you are an independent controller of data relating to other users that you may have
                    obtained through the Services.</p>
                <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 18px;">You are responsible for protecting user personal
                    information you receive or process and complying with all relevant legal requirements when you use
                    the Services. This includes applicable data protection and privacy laws that govern the ways in
                    which you can use a user’s information. Such laws may require that you post, and comply with, your
                    own privacy policy, which must be accessible to your users and compatible with this policy and
                    Rapidbott’s Terms of Use. For more information on the General Data Protection Regulation, see more
                    resources at https://gdpr-info.eu and http://gdprandyou.ie</p>
                <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 18px;">As a data controller, to the extent that you
                    process users’ personal information outside of the Services, you may be required under applicable
                    data protection and privacy laws to honor requests for data access, portability, correction,
                    deletion, and objections to processing. Also, if you disclose personal information without the
                    user’s proper consent, you are responsible for that unauthorized disclosure. This includes, for
                    example, disclosures you intentionally make or unintentional data breaches. For example, you may
                    receive an End-User’s email address or other information as a result of entering into a transaction
                    with that End User. This information may only be used for the authorized purpose. You may not use
                    this information for unsolicited commercial messages or unauthorized transactions. Without the
                    End-User’s consent, and subject to other applicable Rapidbott policies and laws, you may not add any
                    End User to your email or physical mailing list, use that End-User’s identity for marketing, or
                    obtain or retain any payment information. Please bear in mind that you're responsible for knowing
                    the standard of consent required in any given instance. If Rapidbott and you are found to be joint
                    data controllers of personal information, and if Rapidbott is sued, fined, or otherwise incurs
                    expenses because of something that you did as a joint data controller of End-Users’ personal
                    information, you agree to indemnify Rapidbott for the expenses it occurs in connection with your
                    processing of End-Users’ personal information.</p>
                <h2 style="margin-top: 60px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: 'Montserrat'; font-weight: 700;">Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 18px;">We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to
                    change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes or updates
                    will be effective immediately upon posting to this page. You should review this Privacy Policy
                    regularly for changes. You can determine if changes have been made by checking the Effective Date at
                    the top of this page. Your continued use of our services following the posting of any changes to
                    this Privacy Policy means you consent to such changes.</p>
